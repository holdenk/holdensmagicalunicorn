A very simple github bot. Uses an accout of the same name. It provides spelling corrections for README files and other simple suggestions.
Requires pfff & php for the php code fixing to work.
The current method it works is find_targets[*].pl finds possible files on github that might have something we could do to them.
Then find_errors.pl will do a basic check
Then fix_pandas.pl does the "hard" work
Update settings.yml to have your credientals
