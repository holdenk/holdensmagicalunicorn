The PHP spatches are broken up into two groups, ones which _can_ automatically fix the code and ones that can not automatically fix the code. The ones that can not automatically fix the code are useful for flagging issues for the developer to work on and also (possibly) if we notice them triggering often seeing we can create a better rule which could automatically solve the issue.
